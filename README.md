# keras car-prices

## Car sales price prediction

the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/GauSim/keras-car-prices/blob/master/notebook.ipynb) uses the csv data input 
of historical car price sales to predict if a price for a car is `BARGAIN` , `FAIR_PRICE` or `BAD_DEAL`.
It uses features (Price, Age, KM, FuelType, HP, MetColor, Automatic, CC, Doors, Weight) to train a classifier neural net.
